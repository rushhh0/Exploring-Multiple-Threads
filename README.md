Project #2 Exploring Multiple Threads

Project Description:

A hotel is simulated by using threads and semaphores to model customer and employee behavior. The hotel to be simulated has two employees at the front desk to register guests and two bellhops to handle guestsâ€™ bags.  A guest will first visit the front desk to get a room number.  The front desk employee will find an available room and assign it to the guest.  If the guest has less than 3 bags, the guest proceeds directly to the room.  Otherwise, the guest visits the bellhop to drop off the bags.  The guest will later meet the bellhop in the room to get the bags, at which time a tip is given.  

My File Description:

Hotel.cpp contains Guest Class, FrontDesk Class, Bellhop Class and Main:

Guest Class:
- The Guest class represents a hotel guest. Each guest is assigned a unique ID, a room number, and a random number of bags.
- Guests enter the hotel, register at the front desk, receive a room key, and optionally request bellhop assistance for their luggage.
- They then enter their assigned room, and later retire for the evening.

FrontDesk Class:
- The FrontDesk class represents a front desk employee. 2 front desk employees are created to handle guest registrations.
- Front desk employees wait for guests to be ready, assign a room number, and provide room keys.

Bellhop Class:
- The Bellhop class represents a bellhop employee. 2 bellhop employees are created to handle luggage assistance requests from guests.
- Bellhops receive luggage requests from guests, assist with the luggage, and deliver it to the guest's room.

Main:
- The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes semaphores, creates threads for front desk employees, bellhops, and guests, and manages the overall flow of the simulation. 
- Main function is responsible for cleaning up resources after the simulation ends.

How to Compile:

g++ -std=c++11 Hotel.cpp -lpthread -o Hotel

Note: Hotel is the name of my executable file.

How to Run:

./Hotel
